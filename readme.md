Zomato case study!

In this project I have created a random database that includes data about users and users becoming gold members by paying a subscription fee to avail more features.
The "database code" file contains queries for database creation.
The "Scenarios" and "advanced scenarios" file contains different problems and query solution to it.

PS - Queries will need to be changed a bit as per the SQL server its queried from.
For example - SSMS and workbench have different format to accept Date entry. So keep an eye to change accordingly!
